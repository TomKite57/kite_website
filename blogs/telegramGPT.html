						<h1>telegramGPT: Carry a GPT in your pocket</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
						Okay, I guess GPT was already in your pocket - but not as easy as this!
						After getting tired of constantly reminding openAI that I am indeed a human, I decided to take matters into my own hands.
						Hosting a personal Telegram bot on a Raspberry Pi which calls the API of the world's new favorite AI friend seemed like a worthwhile project.
						Also, it is a good intersection of various buzzwords, and is therefore also a worthwhile blog post.

						This little coding story starts with it being the week of my birthday, and a friend of mine asking me what it is I wanted as a gift.
						He had traveled to visit me in Cambridge (UK), and when he asked me that I knew that we were just minutes walk from the only physical Raspberry Pi shop in the world (or so I am told).
						I had helped this friend build his first gaming PC a year or so earlier, so there was something poetic about it. I traveled home excited by my new pocket sized computer.
						<br /><br />
						But what is a Raspberry Pi good for? What project would I chose that couldn't just be done within my usual setup?
						I had recently heard of how easy it was to create Telegram bots, which would allow you to automate certain tasks and communicate easily with it from either phone or browser.
						This combined with my frustration at constantly logging in to use chatGPT, and constantly ticking a box to prove my human status, led to the idea.
						There is nothing revolutionary in this project at all. In fact, it is quite basic for many developers.
						For me however it exposed me to new ideas like the infinite polling loops while waiting for messages, communicating via API keys, user authorization with ID, persistent state in databases, etc.
						<br /><br />
						While this blog doesn't aim to be a tutorial, I hope some other aspiring developers or code enthusiasts will enjoy a slight demystifying of concepts here, and perhaps a bit of inspiration for their own projects.

					<p>
						Let's start with the bot itself. Telegram bots are super easy to set up.
						If you are using python, like I was, then <a href="https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI#writing-your-first-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> shows you most of what you need.
						The starting code they provide looks like this:
					</p>
					<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python">import telebot

bot = telebot.TeleBot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")

@bot.message_handler(commands=['start', 'help'])
def send_welcome(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, "Howdy, how are you doing?")

@bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: True)
def echo_all(message):
	bot.reply_to(message, message.text)

bot.infinity_polling()</code></pre>
					<p>
						The code imports the telebot module, and creates an instance of the TeleBot class which takes the bot token as argument
						(this is a unique key for your bot, don't share it with anyone!).
						<br /><br />
						The TeleBot instance provides a function decorator
						(see <a href="https://usiam.quarto.pub/python-blogs/posts/decorators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog</a> for a great example based introduction to wrappers)
						which allows you to register callbacks - functions which are called in response to messages the bot receives or over events.
						<br /><br />
						The first callback responds to the commands <i>/start</i> and <i>/help</i>. The second responds to all other messages, in this case by just repeating the message back.
						Two interesting points here: first, the callbacks are essentially checked top to bottom,
						so sending the message <i>/help</i> is answered by the first and only the first callback.
						Second, the lambda function is true for any and all messages, making this a great way to capture every message which didn't pass a previous check.
						<br /><br />
						Oscar Wild said "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness".
						Let's make our mediocre bot less flattering, and actually make it say something new and interesting rather than imitating the user.
						We will do this by forwarding messages to the openAI API, essentially getting a chatGPT response.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="four">
					<p>
						First and foremost, it is worth noting that the openAI API is not free, unlike chatGPT.
						You will have to create a a paid account, and that way get an API key which charges you (again, don't share that key!).
						However, it is extremely cheap! The chatGPT model we will use in this project is gpt-3.5-turbo, which costs $0.002 / 1K tokens.
						Tokens aren't very easy to count, but think along the lines of 2 or 3 tokens per word.
						<br /><br />
						To get started with calling the API check out
						<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this example</a>.
						In particular they show an example like this:
					</p>
					<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python">import openai

openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)</code></pre>
					<p>
						The interesting thing to note here is that whenever you ask your friendly bot something new, you have to show it all the previous conversation
						with each message listed as "user" or "assistant" respectively. The system message simply gives some context for the language model.
						Calling the ChatCompletion.create function will return a dictionary with the response, and some other information.
						The response can then be sent back to the user of the bot, and the conversation thread grows.
						<br /><br />
						Seeing how the API works led to a big design choice in this project, which is to have a ConversationThread class which can store each response,
						have its tokens counted, and can be instantiated for each user of the bot. Importantly, the conversation can be cleared.
						This must be an option the user has since no more than 4096 tokens can be sent to the api (this is model dependent. gpt-4 will greatly improve on this).
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="five">
					<p>
						So that is basically it in terms of background. Everything else comes down to how you choose to weave these two tools together.
						Below I will discuss some of my own design choices. I have no doubt that everything I did could have been done in infinitely better ways.
						<br /><br />
						I wanted to make absolutely sure that nobody could message this bot without my permission, but I didn't want it to be limited to just me.
						I created a series of authorization checks which extract the user id from a Telegram Message object. These checks should be applied to every callback
						function the bot has. I chose to define a decorator factory
						(again, check out <a href="https://usiam.quarto.pub/python-blogs/posts/decorators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog</a>)
						which could then be applied to every function. This solution is repetitive, but is fine for the small number of functions our bot will contain.
						If I had to refactor this, I would probably create an inheritance hierarchy of callable classes and use something akin to the decorator design pattern
						described in the famous Gang of Four book
						(alternatively see it <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
						Here is my code:
					</p>
					<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python">def whitelist_filter_factory(bot, whitelist):
	def whitelist_filter(func):
		def wrapped(message):
			if message.from_user.id in whitelist:
				func(message)
			else:
				response = f"Your id is not whitelisted to use this bot."
				bot.send_message(get_chat_id(message), response)
		return wrapped
	return whitelist_filter</code></pre>
					<p>
						The reason this is a decorator factory rather than just a decorator is because I need the bot to be taken as an argument, so we can
						warn the user if they're not whitelisted. I created a similar decorator for adding new users if they are whitelisted, but not yet in the database
						of conversations. Both these decorators will be seen in the final code snippet at the end of this blog.
					</p>
				</section>

			<section id="six">
				<p>
					A second design choice is that I wanted conversations to be preserved, even if the bot goes offline (e.g. the Raspberry Pi turns off).
					The idea of having persistent state is ubiquitous in so much of programming, and consequently there are arbitrarily many databases to choose from.
					In my personal coding experience this is a new venture for me, as normally I run a script with inputs and simply save the outputs for analysis later.
					There isn't a long term "recall" of some memory. I therefore didn't want to use a black box as my database, instead choosing a low tech solution I could see more clearly.
					I chose to save a dictionary with keys being user ids (extracted from the Telegram Message object) and values being a UserProfile class. That class in turn contains the name
					of the user and a current ConversationThread. This database was saved and loaded as needed using
					<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pickle</a>.
					The idea of Pickling is to save an arbitrary python object as serialized data.
					In the end my crude database usage looked something like this:
				</p>
					<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path
import pickle

def load_db():
	with open(PICKLE_FNAME, 'rb') as file:
	obj = pickle.load(file)
	return obj

def save_db(db):
	with open(PICKLE_FNAME, 'wb') as file:
		pickle.dump(db, file)

def get_user_profile(user_id):
	db = load_db()

	assert user_id in db, "User id not currently in database"

	return db[user_id]</code></pre>
				<p>
					The new user decorator factory mentioned earlier will add users to the database.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="seven">
				<p>
					Earlier we saw how to define commands. Let's now write some commands which will help us control the bot.
					I also mentioned previously that tokens build up throughout a conversation, and must be routinely cleared
					(just like starting a new conversation on the usual chatGPT).
					I defined two commands <i>/count</i> and <i>/clear</i> which did these tasks.
					For counting tokens a useful code snippet is given
					<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
					Clearing the conversation was as simple as loading the corresponding UserProfile from the database and clearing the currently stored messages.
					<br /><br />
					Some other commands I defined were an <i>/init</i>, which takes a new users name.
					Also a <i>/help</i> command, which simply tells the user what the bot is and what other commands exist.
					A final set of commands are probably terrible practice, but were interesting and helpful in debugging.
					It turns out that you easily terminate and rerun a python code from within the python code itself,
					so my workflow became a back and forth between typing new python code and then messaging the bot itself on telegram with a <i>/restart</i> command!
					<br /><br />
					In general, debugging became a surreal experience since I could, in some sense, talk to my code.
					For example, my way of checking if emojis were a dangerous edge case was to ask the bot "do you understand this?" and send a duck emoji.
					It proceeded to describe to be what a duck is. No need to check for emojis!

				<p>
					As a bottom line result to this blog I will show the main function which sends GPT responses to the user:
				</p>
				<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python"># MESSAGE HANDLER
@bot.message_handler(func=lambda msg: True)
@whitelist_filter_factory(bot, WHITELIST)
@new_user_factory(bot)
def chatGPT_call(message):
	user_id = message.from_user.id
	text = message.text
	date = message.date

	user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
	user_profile.current_conversation.add_message(Message(text, "user", date))

	response_json = conversation_api_call(user_profile.current_conversation.open_ai_format())
	response = response_json["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

	user_profile.current_conversation.add_message(Message(response, "assistant", date))
	save_user_profile(user_id, user_profile)

	bot.send_message(get_chat_id(message), response)</code></pre>
				<p>
					A lot of this code delegates responsibility to other smaller functions (as code should!), but hopefully it illustrates the different building blocs of this project.
					This function responds to all messages that didn't trigger a previous callback function (one of those is a regex check for an unknown command).
					The code then assumes it is a GPT prompt. First it retrieves the UserProfile from the database, and adds the new prompt as a message from "user".
					This is forwarded to the openAI API, and the response content is extracted from the dictionary. This is also added to the conversation as being from the "assistant".
					The new conversation is saved back into the database for safe keeping, and the bot gives the response to the user.
					<br /><br />
					This project has honestly been very useful, and it is now my favorite way to interact with chatGPT.
					It is easy to quickly send a message when you are on the go,
					and in one case I even sent a message while I had no internet access, knowing I would get a response as soon as I was back online.
					<br /><br />
					To take the project further I do plan on adding new features. Firstly I would like to add a logging system, since I'd like to keep track of what goes wrong
					(from the user end you will just never get a response, without knowing why) and how to fix it. Also I would like to know if some user who isn't whitelisted tries to
					use the bot. Secondly, I want to be able to <i>/save</i> and <i>/load</i> conversations akin to what chatGPT has. This way some interesting ConversationThread could be saved for later.
					I would also add a <i>/remind</i> command to see what that whole conversation was, without using any more tokens.
					A final learning opportunity I plan to derive from all this is to create a Docker container for this project, making it easier to host on the Raspberry Pi without simply leaving
					a terminal in an infinite polling state. This might also allow me to automatically redeploy the bot from the main branch of a git repo.
					This way I could stop the tedious process of accessing the Raspberry Pi through SSH.
