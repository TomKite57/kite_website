						<h1>cpp_grad: a first adventure into backpropagation and neural networks</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
						When I discovered Andrej Karpathy's tutorial for micrograd I was immediately hooked.
						In my experience it is rare to find resources on neural networks that build the code from scratch.
						Andrej Karpathy however does a great job of explaining the fundamentals, and using simple yet powerful python code to demonstrate the principles.
						I wanted to implement the code for myself, and decided C++ would deliever a healthy challenge while potentially giving enough speed to make the code useful.
						I called it cpp_grad.

					<p>
						I didn't realise when I first started this task how much this would refine my thinking of C++.
						I have developed in C++ for a number of years now, I have listened to podcasts with Bjarne Stroustrup and read the "tour guide".
						I am familiar with the ideas of RAII, object lifetime, the lack of garbage collection.
						This project really made me confront everything I had read and understood in theory.
						<br />
						The essential issue is that micrograds backpropagation relies on each value keeping track of its parents and the operation that gave rise to it.
						For example, the value C = A + B must <i>remember</i> who A and B are so it can update their gradients later. Simple enough right?
						The line that first made me realise something subtle was going on here was writing a loss function as a sum of squares.
						Here we will simply write L = A^2 + B^2 + C^2 as an example. The point is that A, B and C are not going to be local variables on the stack unless you have some horribly hardcoded neural netowrk.
						And further to this, we want to be able to write code like x = x + 10. But then who is the parent of x?
						<br />
						The key to resolving this is to divorce the <i>user facing</i> memory address accessible through x,
						and the true memory address of the backpropagated values which must be created and kept alive somehow when temporary values like x + 10 arise.
